## Description

Using mySQL, create a company database to track departments, roles, and employees, and how they  relate to each other. Pre-established portions come already created but as your company grows you can add to or delete from the database as needed.
Since most company administration time comes down to who, what, and where, this aproject allows a user to quickly and easily keep track of their company.
